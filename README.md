## Overview
C-Mask is an app that can detect whether people are wearing masks correctly. There are two measures, first by [single face classification](./Masked_Face_Classification) and another one by [faces object detection](./Masked_Face_Object_Detection). App is created for Android devices, and the inferences are done in cloud back-end. We are implementing MVVM Architecture Pattern and Firebase to store the data
